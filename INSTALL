Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To build salliere you will need a 1.5 compatible Java compiler with at least
1.4 compatible java libraries, libcsv-java
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/javacsv/) and libmatthew-debug-java
(http://www.matthew.ath.cx/projects/java/).

To build:

   make all

To install:

   make install

Both of these can be modified by setting variables. See the Makefile for more
details, but the most likely ones to be changed are:

   PREFIX = install prefix
   JAVAC = Java compiler
   JAVA = Java VM
   CLASSPATH = path to libcsv-java and libmatthew-debug-java
   DEBUG = enable to enable debugging
