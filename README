Salliere Duplicate Bridge Scorer
--------------------------------

Salliere scores, matchpoints and nicely formats the boards for a duplicate
pairs evening. The command line is a list of commands followed by two
comma-separated files on which to operate. 

The syntax is:

   salliere [options] [commands] -- <boards.csv> <names.csv>

The boards file must contain lines with at least board number, NS pair number,
EW pair number, Contract, Declarer and either tricks or the contract must
include whether it made (=) went down (-tricks) or made over tricks (+tricks).
The names file must list at least pair number followed by two comma separated
names. 

The commands will add tricks, scores and matchpoint columns to the boards file
and total matchpoints, percentages and local/orange points to the names file as
appropriate.

By default the commands which print results will do so as ascii to stdout. This
can be changed with the --output=format:file option. Formats are either pdf,
html or txt and file is the path to a file or - for stdout.

The commands which format the output require the extra fields to be added
either by hand or with the appropriate commands so they can be printed.

The commands are as follows:
      
   score
        
      Calculates tricks and score for each contract
        
   matchpoint

   total
        
      Calculates the total match points for each pair
        
   localpoint

   results
